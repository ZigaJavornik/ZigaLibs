TYPE E_FileOpenMode :

	(* r: Opens a file for reading. An error is returned if the file cannot be found or does not exist.*)
	TEXT_READ_MUST_EXIST := Tc2_System.FOPEN_MODEREAD OR Tc2_System.FOPEN_MODETEXT,
	
	(* 	w: Opens an empty file for writing. If the file already exists, it is overwritten.*)
	TEXT_WRITE_OVERWRITE_EXISTING := Tc2_System.FOPEN_MODEWRITE OR Tc2_System.FOPEN_MODETEXT,
	
	(* a: Opens a file for writing at the end of the file (append). If the file does not exist, a new file is created.*)
	TEXT_APPEND_OVERWRITE_EXISTING := Tc2_System.FOPEN_MODEAPPEND OR Tc2_System.FOPEN_MODETEXT,
	
	(* r+: Opens a file for reading and writing. The file must exist.*)

	(* a+: opens a file for reading and writing at the end of the file (append). 
	If the file does not exist, a new file is created. For this, the memory path must be known, otherwise error 1804 appears. 
	All write operations are always performed at end of a file, if the file was opened in the modes a or a+.
	The file pointer can be moved with FB_FileSeek, although for writing it is moved to the end of the file by default, i.e. existing data cannot be overwritten.*)
